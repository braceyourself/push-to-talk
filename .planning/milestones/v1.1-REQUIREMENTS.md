## v1.1 Requirements: Voice UX Polish

### Filler System

- [x] **FILL-01**: Remove Ollama smart filler generation entirely — no LLM-generated filler text
- [x] **FILL-02**: Live session uses only acknowledgment phrase audio clips as fillers (e.g., "let me check that", "one sec")
- [x] **FILL-03**: Clip factory subprocess generates new acknowledgment clips via Piper TTS
- [x] **FILL-04**: Clip pool has a configurable size cap with rotation (phase out old, generate new)
- [x] **FILL-05**: Clip factory evaluates naturalness of generated clips before adding to pool

### STT Reliability

- [x] **STT-01**: Whisper no_speech_prob filtering rejects non-speech segments
- [x] **STT-02**: False trigger rate reduced — throat clearing, coughs, ambient noise don't trigger transcription

### Speech Flow

- [x] **FLOW-01**: Tool-use text suppression — only final post-tool response is spoken
- [x] **FLOW-02**: Inter-tool narration is discarded via post_tool_buffer

### Barge-in

- [x] **BARGE-01**: User can interrupt AI mid-speech by speaking
- [x] **BARGE-02**: VAD detects speech during playback without muting the mic
- [x] **BARGE-03**: Interruption cancels current TTS playback and queued audio
- [x] **BARGE-04**: Interrupted speech is not sent as context (or marked as interrupted)

### Overlay

- [x] **OVL-01**: All status states (listening, thinking, tool_use, speaking, idle, muted) render correctly
- [x] **OVL-02**: Status history panel shows transitions with timestamps

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 15 of 15 requirements
**Adjusted:** FILL-02 — original spec said "non-verbal audio clips (breaths, hums)". Piper TTS cannot produce natural nonverbal interjections, so this was changed to "acknowledgment phrase audio clips" during Phase 6.
**Dropped:** None
