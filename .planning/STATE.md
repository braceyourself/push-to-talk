## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 3-phase structure (rename+session, infra, orchestration) derived from requirement clustering
- Roadmap: Mode rename grouped with live session standup (Phase 1) since rename must happen before new mode exists
- 01-01: Indicator migration reads but does not persist (push-to-talk.py handles saves)
- 01-01: Voice commands for dictate mode: "dictate mode", "go dictate", "dictation mode"

### Pending Todos

None.
